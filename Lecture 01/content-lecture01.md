Lecture Outline: In this first module we get a rough overview on the differences between automatic machine learnig and interactive machine learning and discuss a few future challenges of the MAKE-pipeline as a teaser. MAKE is short for Machine Learning and Knowledge Extraction and this acronym shall emphasize the integrative ML approach, where at first we learn from prior data, then extract knowledge in order to generalize and to detect certain patterns in the data and use these to make predictions and help to make decisons under uncertainty. The grand future goal is in understandability, re-traceability and explainability.
